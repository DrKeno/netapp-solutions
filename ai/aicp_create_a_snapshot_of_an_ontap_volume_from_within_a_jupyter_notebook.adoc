To trigger the creation of a snapshot from within a Jupyter Notebook of a NetApp ONTAP volume that is mounted in the Jupyter Notebook Server’s workspace, perform the following tasks. This operation takes advantage of the NetApp ONTAP REST APIs and the NetApp ONTAP Python module. For more information about the REST APIs and the Python module, see the https://library.netapp.com/ecmdocs/ECMLP2858435/html/index.html[NetApp support site^]. Note that tasks in this section only work for volumes that reside on ONTAP storage systems or software-defined instances.

. Connect to a Jupyter Notebook server’s web interface. See the section link:aicp_provision_a_jupyter_notebook_workspace_for_data_scientist_or_developer_use.html[Provision a Jupyter Notebook Workspace for Data Scientist or Developer Use] for instructions on how to provision a Jupyter Notebook Server.
. Open an existing Python 3 notebook or create a new Python 3 notebook. The following example shows the creation of a new Python 3 notebook.
