This section describes the tasks that you must complete to deploy Kubeflow in your Kubernetes cluster.

=== Prerequisites

Before you perform the deployment exercise that is outlined in this section, we assume that you have already performed the following tasks:

. You already have a working Kubernetes cluster, and you are running a version of Kubernetes that is supported by Kubeflow. For a list of supported versions, see the https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/getting-started/[official Kubeflow documentation^].
. You have already installed and configured NetApp Trident in your Kubernetes cluster as outlined in link:aicp_netapp_trident_deployment_and_configuration_overview.html[Trident Deployment and Configuration].
