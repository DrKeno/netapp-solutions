= Protect your Applications

Once the application workloads are managed by Astra Control Center, it's time to tune the protection settings for those workloads.

== Creating an Application SnapShot

A snapshot of an application creates an ONTAP Snapshot copy which can be used to restore or clone the application to that point-in-time copy of it.

.	To take a snapshot of the application, go to `Apps` -> `Managed` tab and click on the application you wish to take a snapshot of. Click on the dropdown next to the application name and click on `Snapshot`.

. Enter the snapshot details, click on `Review` and then click on `Snapshot`. It will take about a minute to create the snapshot and once it is successfully created, the status becomes `Available`.

== Creating an Application Backup

A backup of an application captures the active state of the application and the configuration of it's resources, coverts them into files and stores them in a remote object storage bucket.

For the backup/restore of managed applications in Astra Control Center, the pre-requisite is to configure superuser settings for the backing ONTAP systems.

This can be performed with the following syntax.

----
ONTAP::> export-policy rule modify -vserver ocp-trident -policyname default -ruleindex 1 -superuser sys
ONTAP::> export-policy rule modify -policyname default -ruleindex 1 -anon 65534 -vserver ocp-trident
----

.	To create a backup of the managed application in Astra Control Center, go to ‘Apps’ -> ‘Managed’ tab and click on the application you wish to take a backup of. Click on the dropdown next to the application name and click on ‘Backup’.

. Enter the backup details, select the object storage that will hold the backup files, then click on ‘Review’ and once the details are reviewed, click on ‘Backup’. Depending on the size of the application and data, the backup can take several minutes and once the backup is completed successfully, the status of the backup becomes ‘Available’.

== Restoring or Cloning an Application

An application can be cloned at the push of a button either to the same, or a remote cluster for test, dev, or application protection / disaster recovery purposes. On similar lines, an application can also be restored to a previous state on the cluster it was backed up or snapshotted from, or to a remote cluster for application migration purposes.

.	To restore/clone an app, navigate to `Apps` -> `Managed` tab and click on the app in question. Click on the dropdown next to the application name and click on `Clone`.

. Enter the details of the new namespace, select the cluster you want to restore/clone it to [can be the same cluster or a different cluster] and choose if you want to restore/clone it from a snapshot or a backup or the current state of the app. Then click on `Review` and click on `Clone` once the details are reviewed.

. The new application goes to `Discovering` state while Astra Control Center creates the application on the selected cluster. Once all the resources of the application are installed and detected by Astra, the application goes to `Available` state.
