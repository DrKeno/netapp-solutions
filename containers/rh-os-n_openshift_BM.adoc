Virtual deployments of OpenShift are quite popular because they allow for ease of deployment, and rapid provisioning and scaling of OpenShift clusters, while also supplying the need to support virtualized workloads for applications that are not ready to be containerized.
This does require extra overhead however in regard to managing the host environment, as well as the OpenShift environment, and introduces addtional limitations as the physical resources have to be shared between both environments.

OpenShift deployed on bare metal provides the following features:

* *IPI or Assisted Installer Deployment* With an OpenShift cluster deployed by Installer Provisioned Infrastructure (IPI) on bare metal servers, customers can deploy an highly versatile, easily scalable OpenShift environment directly on commodity servers, without the need to manage a hypervisor layer.

* *Compact Cluster Design* To minimize the hardware requirements, OpenShift on bare metal allows for users to deploy clusters of just 3 nodes, by enabling the OpenShift control plane nodes to also act as worker nodes and host containers.

* *OpenShift Virtualization* OpenShift can run virtual machines within containers by using OpenShift Virtualization. This container-native virtualization runs the KVM hypervisor inside of a container, and attaches persistent volumes for VM storage.

* *AI/ML-Optimized Infrastructure* Deploy applications like Kubeflow for Machine Learning applications by incorporating GPU-based worker nodes to your OpenShift environment and leveragine OpenShift Advanced Scheduling.


=== Network Design

The Red Hat OpenShift on NetApp solution uses two data switches to provide primary data connectivity at 25Gbps. It also uses two additional management switches that provide connectivity at 1Gbps for in-band management for the storage nodes and out-of-band management for IPMI functionality.

The OpenShift bare metal IPI deployment requires the customer to create a Provisioner node, a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 machine which will need to have network interfaces attached to separate networks.

* *Provisioning Network:* This network is used to boot the bare metal nodes and install the necessary images and packages to deploy the OpenShift cluster.

* *Baremetal Network:* This network is used for public facing communication of the cluster once it is deployed.

The setup of the provisioner node will create bridge interfaces that allow the traffic to route properly both on the node itself and for the Bootstrap VM which will be provisioned for the deployment purposes.

Once the cluster is deployed the API and Ingress VIP addresses will be migrated from the bootstrap node to the newly deployed cluster.

==== VLAN Requirements

The Red Hat OpenShift with NetApp solution is designed to logically separate network traffic for different purposes by using virtual local area networks (VLANs).

|===
|VLANs |Purpose |VLAN ID
|Out-of-band Management Network
|Management for bare metal nodes and IPMI
|16
|Bare Metal Network
|181
|Provisioning Network
|3485
|===

NOTE: While each of these networks were virtually separated by VLANs, each physical port needed to be set up in "access mode" with the primary VLAN assigned, as there is no way to pass a VLAN tag during a PXE boot sequence.

==== Network Infrastructure Support Resources

The following infrastructure should be in place prior to the deployment of the OpenShift Container Platform:

* At least one DNS server which provides a full host-name resolution that is accessible from the in-band management network and the VM network.

* At least one NTP server that is accessible from the in-band management network and the VM network.

* (Optional) Outbound internet connectivity for both the in-band management network and the VM network.
