NetApp Astra Control Center offers a rich set of storage and application-aware data management services for stateful Kubernetes workloads, deployed in an on-premises environment, powered by NetApp’s trusted data protection technology.

NetApp Astra Control Center manages, protects, and moves data-rich Kubernetes workloads in on-premises Kubernetes deployments like Red Hat OpenShift.

NetApp Astra Control enables data protection, disaster recovery, and migration for your Kubernetes workloads by leveraging NetApp’s industry-leading data management technology for snapshots, backups, replication, and cloning.

NetApp Astra Control Center can be installed to a Red Hat OpenShift cluster which has NetApp Trident deployed with configured storage classes, and storage backends to NetApp ONTAP storage systems.

For the installation and configuration of NetApp Trident to support Astra Control Center, see the section in this document, link:rh-os-n_overview_trident.html[here].

In a cloud-connected environment, Astra Control Center uses Cloud Insights to provide advanced monitoring and telemetry. In the absence of a Cloud Insights connection, limited (7-days worth of metrics) monitoring and telemetry will be available in ACC and also exported to Kubernetes native monitoring tools (Prometheus/Grafana) through open metrics endpoints. ACC is fully integrated into the ASUP/AIQ ecosystem to provide support and business users with troubleshooting and usage information. 

In addition to the paid version of Astra Control Center, a 90-day evaluation license will be made available to customers. The evaluation version will be supported through the email and community (Slack channel). Customers have access to these and other Knowledge-base articles and documentation from the in-product support dashboard.
