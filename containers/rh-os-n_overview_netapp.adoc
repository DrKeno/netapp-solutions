* AFF and FAS systems run NetApp ONTAP, and provide storage for both file-based (NFS) and block-based (iSCSI) use cases.

* Cloud Volumes ONTAP and ONTAP-Select provide the same benefits in the cloud and virtual space respectively.

* NetApp Cloud Volumes Service (AWS/GCP) and Azure NetApp Files provide file-based storage in the cloud.

* NetApp Element storage systems provide for block-based (iSCSI) use cases in a highly scalable environment.

* NetApp e-Series and EF-Series storage systems provide an integrated hardware and software solution for dedicated, high-bandwidth applications on simple, fast, reliable storage.


NOTE: Each storage system in the Netapp portfolio can ease both data management and movement between on-premises sites and the cloud, ensuring that your data is where your applications are.
