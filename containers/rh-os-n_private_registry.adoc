For most deployments of Red Hat OpenShift, using a public registry like https://quay.io[Quay.io] or https://hub.docker.com[DockerHub] meets most customer's needs. However there are times when a customer may want to host their own private or customized images.

This procedure documents creating a private image registry which is backed by a persistent volume provided by NetApp Trident and NetApp ONTAP.
