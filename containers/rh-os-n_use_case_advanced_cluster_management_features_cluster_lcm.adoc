. Creating a new OpenShift cluster:
..	Create a provider connection: Navigate to `Provider Connections` and click on `Add a connection`, provide all the details corresponding to the selected provider type and click on `Add`.

+
..	Once the cluster is created, it appears in the cluster list with status `Ready`.

.	Importing an existing cluster:
Navigate to `Clusters` and click on `Add a cluster` -> `Import an existing cluster`, enter the name of the cluster and click on `Save import and generate code`. A command to add the existing cluster is displayed, click on `Copy command` and run the command on the cluster that is to be added to the hub cluster. It initiates the installation of necessary agents on the cluster and once done, it appears in the cluster list with status `Ready`.

.	After creating and importing multiple clusters, they can be monitored and managed from a single console.
