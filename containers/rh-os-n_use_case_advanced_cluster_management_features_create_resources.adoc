== Create Resources on multiple clusters

Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes allows users to create resources on one or more managed clusters simultaneously from the console. As an example, to create a PVC on two different clusters, click on `+` sign on the top bar. Select the clusters on which you want to create the PVC, paste the resource YAML and click on `Create`.
