Depending on the specific use-case, both containers and virtual machines (VMs) are considered to offer an optimal platform for different types of applications.. Hence, many organizations run some of their workloads on containers and some on VMs. Often, this leads organizations to face additional challenges by having to manage separate platforms: a hypervisor for VMâ€™s, and a container orchestrator for applications.

To address this challenge, Red Hat introduced OpenShift Virtualization (formerly known as Container Native Virtualization) starting from OpenShift version 4.6. OpenShift Virtualization is a feature that enables the ability to run and manage virtual machines alongside containers on the same OpenShift Container Platform installation, providing hybrid management capability to automate deployment and management of VMs through operators. In addition to creating VMs in OpenShift, with OpenShift Virtualization, Red Hat also supports importing VMs from VMware vSphere, Red Hat Virtualization, and Red Hat OpenStack Platform deployments.

Certain features like live VM migration, VM disk cloning, VM snapshots etc. are also supported by OpenShift Virtualization with assistance from NetApp Trident when backed by NetApp ONTAP. Examples of each of these workflows will be discussed later in this document, in their respective sections.
