Studies have shown that business application downtime has a significant negative impact on the business of enterprises. In addition to the financial impact, downtime can also damage the companyâ€™s reputation, staff morale, and customer loyalty. Surprisingly, not all companies have a comprehensive disaster recovery policy.

Running SAP HANA on Azure NetApp Files (ANF) gives customers access to additional features that extend and improve the built-in data protection and disaster recovery capabilities of SAP HANA. This overview section explains these options to help customers select options that support their business needs.

To develop a comprehensive disaster recovery policy, customers must understand the business application requirements and technical capabilities they need for data protection and disaster recovery. The following figure provides an overview of data protection.

== Business application requirements

There are two key indicators for business applications:

* The recovery point objective (RPO), or the maximum tolerable data loss
* The recovery time objective (RTO), or the maximum tolerable business application downtime

These requirements are defined by the kind of application used and the nature of your business data. The RPO and the RTO might differ if you are protecting against failures at a single Azure region. They might also differ if you are preparing for catastrophic disasters such as the loss of a complete Azure region. It is important to evaluate the business requirements that define the RPO and RTO, because these requirements have a significant impact on the technical options that are available.

== High availability

The infrastructure for SAP HANA, such as virtual machines, network, and storage, must have redundant components to make sure that there is no single point of failure. MS Azure provides redundancy for the different infrastructure components.

To provide high availability on the compute and application side, standby SAP HANA hosts can be configured for built-in high availability with an SAP HANA multiple-host system. If a server or an SAP HANA service fails, the SAP HANA service fails over to the standby host, which causes application downtime.

If application downtime is not acceptable in the case of server or application failure, you can also use SAP HANA system replication as a high-availability solution that enables failover in a very short time frame. SAP customers use HANA system replication not only to address high availability for unplanned failures, but also to minimize downtime for planned operations, such as HANA software upgrades.
