== Automated Deployment of Oracle19c for ONTAP NFS

This solution utilizes Ansible to enable storage administrators, systems administrators and DBAs to consistently and rapidly deploy new storage, configure database servers, and install Oracle19c:

* Eliminates design complexities, and provides a repeatable consistent deployment
* Decreases time for provisioning of storage, configuration of DB hosts, and Oracle installation
* Enables scaling of storage and number of databases
* Designed to run on RHEL 7/8 and Oracle Linux 7/8

= Requirements

:imagesdir: ./../media/

== Ansible Environment
* Ansible version 2.10 and above
* Python 3
* Python libraries:
** netapp-lib
** xmltodict
** jmespath

== ONTAP
* ONTAP version 9.3 - 9.8
* Two data aggregates
* NFS vlan and ifgrp created

== Linux
* RHEL 7/8
* Oracle Linux 7/8
* NFS vlan configured interface
* Oracle installation files need to be copied to the DB servers

= Automation Details
=== The automation has been built for the end user to execute in three separate plays.
* ontap_config
** Pre-check of the ONTAP environment
** Creation of NFS based SVM for Oracle
** Creation of export policy
** Creation of volumes for Oracle
** Creation of NFS LIFs
* linux_config
** Create mount points and mount NFS volumes
** Verify NFS mounts
** OS specifc configuration, (prereq packages/libraries for Oracle)
** Create Oracle directories
** Configure hugepages
** Disable SELinux and Firewall Daemon
** Enable and start chronyd service
** Increase file descriptor hard limit
** Create pam.d session file
* oracle_config
** Oracle software installation
** Create oracle listener
** Create oracle databases
** Oracle environment configuration
** Save PDB state
** Enable instance archive mode
** Enable dnfs client
** Enable database auto startup and shutdown between OS reboots
