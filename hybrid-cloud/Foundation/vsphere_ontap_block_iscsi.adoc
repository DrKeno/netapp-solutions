.About this task
Creation of VMFS datastore with ONTAP iSCSI storage. 

.What you will need

. ONTAP Storage System (FAS/AFF/CVO/ONTAP Select)
.. Running with ONTAP 9.8 or above
. ONTAP Credentials (SVM Name, UserID, Password)
. ONTAP Network Port Information for iSCSI
. vCenter Server Credentials
. vSphere Host(s) Information
.. version 7.x or above
. iSCSI VMKernel Adapter IP Informattion
. Network Switch(es)
.. with ONTAP System Network Data ports and vSphere hosts are connected
..  VLAN(s) configured for iSCSI.
.. (Optional) Link aggregation configured for ONTAP Nettwork Data ports.
. ONTAP Tool for VMware vSphere deployed, configured and ready to consume.

.Steps

. Check compatability with https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix[Interoperability Matrix Tool (IMT)]

. Verify ONTAP license for iSCSI
Use `system license show` command and check iSCSI is listed.
Use `license add -license-code <license code>` to add license.

. Ensure SAN protocol of your preference is enabled on SVM
. Ensure Logical Interfaces are available on SVM for the protocol of your choice.
. Create and Map LUN/Namespace - Skip if using ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere

* Tasks on VMware vSphere

    . Ensure at least 1 NIC connected to iSCSI VLAN. (Two preferred for better performance and fault tolerance)
    . Ensure iSCSI Software initiator is enabled
    . Ensure TCPIP stack for iSCSI is available.
    . Ensure iSCSI portgroups are available.
    . Ensure iSCSI VMKernel adapters are enabled to match the number of NICs and IP are assigned.
    . Bind iSCSI software adapter to iSCSI VMKernel adapter(s)
    . Provision VMFS datastore with ONTAP Tools.

.What's next?

Once the tasks are completed, VMFS datastore is ready to consume for provisioning virtual machines.
